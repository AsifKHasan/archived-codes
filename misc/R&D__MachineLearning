                                      ----------------------------------------------------


1) Task: Student Performance( For CSSM Project)
   Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance
   Algorithm : Regression or Classification
   Use case: We will be able to apply it for different kind of performance matrix scenario

2) Task: Object Detection From Streaming Video
   Dataset: Data will be taken from webcam or security camera or from other data source
   Algorithm: Classification (Tensorflow or Theano)
   Use case: We can use it for object detection and and facial recognition

3) Task: Credit Approval
   Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval
   Algorithm: Classification (Tensorflow or Theano)
   Use case: We can use it for criteria based approval scenario
